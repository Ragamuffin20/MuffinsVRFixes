# MuffinsVRFixes

Custom ComfyUI nodes for my VR360/180 workflows.

## Included Nodes that are mine

- VR180 Stereo Tools (extract, rebuild, copy SBS cross-eyed video frames)
- MuffinsOffsetNode (GIMP-style image offset utility)

*all other nodes in the workflow were not created by me and can be downloaded via the manager
## Install

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/MuffinsVRFixes.git
